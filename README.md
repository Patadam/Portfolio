# Portfolio
Thank you for checking out my personal portfolio.

## How its made
This portfolio is hosted on Netlify with a custom domain at <a href='https://patadamrich.com'>https://patadamrich.com/</a>.
The site is constructed using: 
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript.

This project was built in late 2021 as a place to showcase my various works. It has undergone many iterations throughout its small lifetime.

### What I Learnt
- Optimisation, Images take up a lot of time and space that can be easily reduced with compression and sizing.
- Performance, Up until now I had never really thought about performance much but I realised that if I want to show off the best of my abilities I need to do so in the most optimised way. So I spent time reducing images sizes, following guides and advice from tests like 'lighthouse' and browsing the DevTools for new ways to improve the site.
- Host, The distribution of a website from various hosts can greatly impact on the end-users performance and time-load. Selecting a host is difficult on a non-existant budget.

## To Do (improvements)
- Add Navigation support to mobile version
